# Spring and K6 (Load Testing)

This project is a basic Spring Boot application that exposes an endpoint to
create and query the objects created in an in-memory data. The project
demonstrates how to use K6 to perform various load testing on your application,
and to review the results in a web-based dashboard.

## K6 folder

The K6 scripts are added to the `/src/test/load` folder. Read the `README.md`
file added to that folder.
